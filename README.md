## gratitude and respect

This source code repository, automation within, and the artifacts generated
depend upon components built, refined, and maintained by members of the
[_free and open-source software (FOSS)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)
community from around the globe, many of whom are _volunteers_ who have donated
labor or expertise, of their own free will.

Open-source software stewardship is a necessary, yet often thankless, labor of
love, without which many of the technology products and companies we love would
not exist as they do today.

**Thank You to all open-source contributors for your hard work and generosity.**
