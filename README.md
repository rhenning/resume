## Who am I?

__Hi.__ My name is Richard Henning&mdash;"Rich" to most&mdash;a technologist, software
engineer, and creative hailing from Philadelphia, the _City of Brotherly Love_ and
birthplace of the United States.

I've been fascinated both by making things and taking them apart, in order to
understand what makes them tick, for about as long as I can remember, much to
the dismay of my patient and loving parents at times.

Perhaps that was Dad's motivation for giving the gift of a used Commodore all
along&mdash;I might cease taking apart his turntable and guitar pedals.

I got hooked, and spent my formative years getting to know others in the local BBS
scene, exploring the use of early MIDI synthesizers&mdash;some coincidentally built by
_Ensoniq_, founded by former Commodore engineers&mdash;and MOD trackers as music
production tools, learning basic microelectronics, and finding my way around the
early Internet with a little help from my friends.

When it was time to choose a career path, it seemed only natural to continue in a
related direction. I began exploring Linux as a primary OS toward the end of high
school and throughout early college, inspired by a friend and mentor who showed
me the ropes of open source and how Linux could breathe new life into "obsolete"
hardware repurposed for server and embedded applications.

Throughout my first "real" technology job after college, I continued to explore the
application of Linux, Unix, and free software to computing problems both at home
and at work&mdash;despite working at a largely _"Windows"_ shop&mdash;with no budget, but keen
to reduce toil and manual process involved in day-to-day operations.

When _Fastnet_&mdash;a Pennsylvania-based ISP and hosting provider I very much respected&mdash;
was seeking out Linux sysadmins, I responded to their ad, was granted an interview,
and received an offer, which I graciously accepted.

I remained at Fastnet for about eight years&mdash;the longest stint of my career&mdash;surviving
the dot-com boom, bust, a merger with _NetAxs_&mdash;another well-regarded Philly-area ISP&mdash;
and two subsequent acquisitions. Fastnet practiced what we now call _"DevOps"_ and
_"Pair Programming"_ organically through culture, before they were commonplace,
and I owe a great debt of gratitude to my colleagues and mentors there, several
of whom have become lifelong friends.

From that time forward I have been fortunate to work for a number of forward-
looking tech companies with amazing teams across varied domains, including Media
and Entertainment, Internet and Data Center Services, Telecom, Web and Server
Hosting, Public and Private Cloud, and Document Organization, Classification, and
Archival.

A cross-section of these companies and their products include:

* __Warner Bros. Discovery__ &mdash; where I worked on ___Max___
* __WarnerMedia__ &mdash; where I worked on ___HBO Max___
* __Comcast/Xfinity__ &mdash; where I worked on ___Xfinity Stream___ and the ___X1 Video Platform___
* __The Lime Group/Lime Labs__ &mdash; where I worked on ___Jux, LimeBits, LimeDomains___
  and ___LimeExchange___ (and _LimeWire_'s parent organization)
* __Fastnet & NetAxs__ &mdash; popular Philadelphia-area ISPs specializing in business and
  residential Internet, shared and dedicated web server hosting, colocation, email,
  DNS, newsgroups, monitoring & metrics, disaster recovery, managed data center,
  and professional consulting services

## Gratitude and Respect

This source code repository, the automation within, and generated artifacts depend
upon software components that have been built, refined, and maintained by members
of the [_Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS)_][FOSS] community from around the
globe, many of whom are _volunteers_ who have donated their labor and expertise
to the public domain, of their own free will.

Open-source software stewardship is a necessary, yet often thankless, labor of
love, without which many of the technology products and companies we love would
not exist as they do today.

__Thank You to all open-source contributors for your hard work and generosity.__
