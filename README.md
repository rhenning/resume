## Who am I?

_**Hi.**_ :wave:

My name is Richard Henning—"Rich" to most—a technologist, software engineer,
and creative hailing from Philadelphia, the _City of Brotherly Love_ and birthplace of
the United States.

I've been fascinated both by making things and taking them apart, in order to
understand what makes them tick, for about as long as I can remember, much to
the dismay of my patient and loving parents at times.

Perhaps that was Dad's motivation for giving the gift of a used Commodore all
along—I might stop taking apart his turntable and guitar pedals.

I got hooked, and spent my formative years getting to know others in the local
BBS scene, exploring the use of MOD trackers and early MIDI synthesizers—some
built by _Ensoniq_, a firm founded by former Commodore engineers—as music
production tools, learning basic microelectronics, and finding my way around the
early Internet with a little help from my friends.

When it was time to choose a career path, it seemed only natural to continue in a
related direction. I began exploring Linux as a primary OS toward the end of high
school and throughout early college, inspired by a friend and mentor who showed
me the ropes of open source and how Linux could breathe new life into "obsolete"
hardware repurposed for server and embedded applications.

Throughout my first "real" technology job after college, I continued to explore the
application of Linux, Unix, and free software to computing problems both at home
and at work—despite working at a largely _"Windows"_ shop—with no budget, but keen
to reduce toil and manual process involved in day-to-day operations.

When _Fastnet_—a Pennsylvania-based ISP and hosting provider I very much respected—
was seeking out Linux sysadmins, I responded to their ad, was granted an interview,
and received an offer, which I graciously accepted.

I remained at Fastnet for about eight years—the longest stint of my career—surviving
the dot-com boom, bust, a merger with _NetAxs_—another well-regarded Philly-area ISP—
and two subsequent acquisitions. Some of us at Fastnet practiced what we might now
call _"DevOps"_ and _"Pair Programming"_, organically through culture before these were
common parlance. I owe a great debt of gratitude to my colleagues and mentors
there, several of whom have become lifelong friends.

From that time forward I've been fortunate to work for a number of forward-looking
tech companies with amazing teams spanning varied domains, including Media and
Entertainment, Internet and Data Center Services, Telecommunications, Web and
Server Hosting, Public and Private Cloud, and Document Organization, Classification,
and Archival.

A cross-section of these companies and their products includes:

* **Warner Bros. Discovery** — where I worked on _**Max**_.
* **WarnerMedia** — where I worked on _**HBO Max**_.
* **Comcast/Xfinity** — where I worked on _**Xfinity Stream**_ and the _**X1 Video Platform**_.
* **The Neat Company** — where I worked on _**NeatCloud**_.
* **The Lime Group/Lime Labs** — where I worked on _**Jux, LimeBits, LimeDomains**_
  and _**LimeExchange**_ (and _LimeWire_'s parent organization.)
* **Fastnet & NetAxs** — popular Philadelphia-area ISPs specializing in business and
  residential Internet, shared and dedicated web server hosting, colocation, email,
  DNS, newsgroups, monitoring & metrics, disaster recovery, managed data centers,
  and professional consulting services.

## Gratitude and Respect

This source code repository, the automation within, and generated artifacts depend
upon software components that have been built, refined, and maintained by members
of the [_Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS)_][FOSS] community from around the
globe, many of whom are _volunteers_ who have donated their labor and expertise
to the public domain, of their own free will.

Open-source software stewardship is a necessary, yet often thankless, labor of
love, without which many of the technology products and companies we love would
not exist as they do today.

**Thank You to all open-source contributors for your hard work and generosity.**
