## Professional Experience

**Warner Bros. Discovery** – Philadelphia, US  
Principal Engineer, [**_Max_**](max.com)  
2022 - 2024

I am a Software & Platform Engineer-Architect working closely with tech leaders
from across the newly-combined WBD organization. Our team partners with service
engineering teams in order to promote, integrate with, and steer the design and
implementation of multitenant cloud infrastructure, compute, delivery, data,
messaging, observability, and networking tools. These platform tools lay the
foundation for successful delivery of WBD's flagship entertainment products –
such as _Max_ – at global scale.

* Advocate for platform-as-product north star, inner-source, collective
  platform ownership, and software stewardship; I often act in a de facto
  product owner role, elevating the asks of our internal customer-colleagues
  during design and planning sessions.

  Engineering, Boundary Services, and Asynchronous Messaging Services.
* Liaison between numerous business stakeholders & partners, often facilitating
  communication and visual aide needed to solve thorny cross-provider issues.
* Longer-term focus on successful buildout of a global, multitenant, security
  and privacy compliant asynchronous messaging platform and provisioning DSL.
  This platform pillar supports a number of buffered, reliable cross-service
  communication needs, from event-based microservices to observability tools.
  The tech stack includes components from Apache Kafka, AWS MSK, Confluent,
  Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS Private Link & Transit Gateway, Prometheus,
  Grafana, and Protocol Buffers, with bindings and tools written in Go and
  Python.

**WarnerMedia** – Philadelphia, US  
Principal Software Engineer, [**_HBO Max_**](hbomax.com)  
2021 - 2022

As a member of the Strategic Global Infrastructure group, our team was
responsible for ensuring that day-to-day changes to live cloud infrastructure,
security policy, networking, compute clusters, and delivery tools were
delivered safely and in accordance with industry best practices.

**Comcast** – Philadelphia, US  
Principal Software Engineer, X1 Video Platform & Xfinity Stream  
2016 - 2021

I was embedded as a cloud and infrastructure-as-code specialist within a cross-
functional team of software engineers responsible for end-to-end development,
infrastructure, delivery, operations, and support of the XVP and Xfinity Stream
APIs and supporting services. These APIs power video discovery and playback
experiences for tens of millions of customers and business partners with Smart
TVs, mobile devices, web browsers, and integrated products such as Roku, Xumo
and Sky Glass.

* Led iterative migration of live production APIs at scale – from on-premise
  managed hardware to hybrid-cloud to all-AWS public cloud – over an extended
  time period of continuous customer growth.
* Co-designed, implemented, and operated a global software load balancer, API
  gateway, and QoS system. It virtually eliminated high-severity incidents due
  to data center or app server failure and facilitated live capacity planning
  exercises. Wrote acceptance test tools and a control plane API in Go.
* Advisor on topics including resilient Hybrid Cloud Architecture, Cloud
  Networking and Security, Operations, Continuous Delivery, Infrastructure as
  Code, Infrastructure Testing, Capacity Planning and AutoScaling, and Global
  Server Load Balancing.
* Participated in Lead Developer, Solutions Architect, and Project Manager roles
  for Platform Team properties including Global Load Balancer, API Gateway,
  Continuous Delivery, and Cloud Hosting platforms.
* Performed daily code reviews, enjoys pair programming, hands-on collaboration,
  and mentoring of junior colleagues.
* Met with Finance for quarterly cloud budget reviews.  
* Organization-wide co-facilitator of DevSecOps Guild and Cloud Security Liaison

**Weblinc Commerce** – Philadelphia, US  
Operations Engineer, Information Technology  
2014 - 2016

* Lead Engineer on a team of 7, responsible for IT Operations, Infrastructure,
  Site Reliability, Security, Compliance and Delivery for 15+ eCommerce project
  development teams serving 50+ clients.
* Worked closely with CTO and IT Manager to create mentorship opportunities,
  design and implement tools and processes to scale the Ops team from a single
  infrastructure code committer to 6 teammates.
* Wrote infrastructure-as-code to provision PCI-compliant cloud infrastructure
  for clients and project teams. A largely manual, tribal-knowledge process that
  took up to two weeks was converted to code that ran in about an hour. This
  work directly contributed to a 400% increase in the number of client launches.
* Designed & developed a “TLS as a service” API to secure up to 10,000 domains
  for a client’s multi-store installation. We securely integrated SSL certificate
  and key management into each member’s store, at a cost and scale that would
  have been impossible using standard cloud-based approaches to TLS. Tech
  included Rails-API, Hashicorp Vault & Consul, PostgreSQL, HAProxy and Nginx.
* Implemented CI/CD tests for infrastructure and configuration management code.
* Pair programming, code reviews, and mentoring of junior colleagues; Close
  collaboration with team leads and project managers of implementation teams.
* Federated authentication, authorization and auditing across 3 data centers,
  30 AWS accounts and about 500 systems.

**The Neat Company** – Philadelphia, US  
Operations Engineer, DevOps Lead  
2012 - 2014

* Member of a geographically diverse team of full-stack developers, QA and Ops
  engineers managing development, CI, hosting, and operations across several
  service stacks. Tech included AWS, Rails, TravisCI, GitHub, Chef, MongoDB,
  PostgreSQL, MemcacheD, Redis, and ElasticSearch.
* Worked with developers to implement automated provisioning and autoscaling
  using AWS CloudFormation and Chef. This work improved developer productivity
  and system reliability by reducing provisioning time and errors, making the
  evolution of infrastructure over time visible, and empowering any engineer to
  provision their own complete development stack.
* Improved DR and scaling of MongoDB by implementing snapshot-based backup and
  restore. This resulted in reliable, fast restores and the ability to pre-seed
  new replicas so we could quickly add capacity.  Wrote a cache-warming tool
  (<https://github.com/rhenning/bunsen>) to facilitate pre-fetching data from
  backups to improve performance of new replicas.
* Improved Chef development workflow by removing internal forks of community
  cookbooks and implementing cookbook tests with Test Kitchen, ServerSpec, and
  MiniTest.
* Developed provisioning and command-and-control tools centered around Chef
  plugins to automate daily operations tasks.
* Pair programming, daily code reviews, and mentoring of junior colleagues.

**Jux LLC** (formerly part of the Lime Group) – New York City, US  
IT Operations, Systems Engineering, Build/Release Engineering  
2010 - 2011

* Managed and mentored a geographically diverse team of system administrators.
  Responsibilities included performance reviews, candidate interviews,
  architecture, administration, security, capacity planning, budgeting,
  monitoring, on-call escalations, vendor relations, inventory, disaster
  recovery and documentation.
* Designed and deployed AAA systems to manage and audit access to workstations,
  servers, routers, firewalls, and source code management tools. Tech included
  MIT Kerberos, OpenLDAP, SSH, TACACS+, RADIUS, SASL, rsyslog and Simple Event
  Correlator (SEC).
* Worked with developers to design and implement virtualization stacks for
  several projects, based on XenServer and VMware clustering, iSCSI mass storage,
  802.1Q VLANs. Network resource management and build automation were streamlined
  by combining Cobbler/Kickstart with the VMware & XenServer API tools.  A
  dedicated management network allowed for lights-out management of failed
  systems via IPMI, and also backups.
* Led developers in migrating all physical data center resources to AWS, which
  lowered operating expenses, eliminated sysadmin trips to the data center, and
  greatly reduced turnaround time for new infrastructure -- from weeks to under
  an hour in most cases. Cloud automation and resource management were
  implemented with AWS CLI tools and Chef.
* Automated product build/tag/backup/deploy process, virtually eliminating
  downtime associated with production code releases. Tools used included Ruby,
  Git, Net-SSH and Chef.
